Yeah he buy you clothes, I hit it from the back
Yeah he drive a Benz, I'm in a woodwill Cadillac
He readin' you poetry while I'm spitttin' this country game
You want us just play this pimpin' don't be ashamed
It's a shame these soft pretty boy mean nothin'
Since these that comin' through for you then start bustin'
We out cousin like Macks and ready for car jacks
Rollin' up on a slab with yak and some fat sacks like that, yeah

All these bars all these cars
All these big time superstars
All these ladies at this bar
Watch these haters play their parts
You can't stop me or my pimpin'
'Cause you lame and you be simpin'
I'm like Micheal you be pippen'
Table dance but sky ain't tippin'

The sight of you
The smell of you
The way you move
Has got me in the mood
You seem so cool
You're style is smooth
My search is done
'Cuz I found you
9: 15 and baby the night is young plus you told me
That you were gonna give me some

Hey baby girl what's your name who you with?
Do you do wanna get down with this pimpin' lil' trick
Tell me what you like, what you love we can do?
No matter what it is I can make it come true
Never gave da Benz the Ferrari or the Lac
Tell me what you wanna drive and you got it like that?
I'm givin' you the chance this the opportunity
You can have it all but you gotta choose me, choose me

Came in Theresa, Michelle and Felicia
Jackie and Rene', Raquel and Shey Shey

Tell me what you wanna drive and you got it like that
I'm givin' you the chance this the opportunity
You can have it all but you gotta choose me, choose me

Choose me big banner the back beater
The dubz can't fit on the truck they caught fevers
25 inches I can clear the benches
Or we can go up and down like them rug bitches
Let them hatin' witches they gonna wish for hate
But they all scream damn while you masturbate

The worm on the hook, I can whip and cook
Hit the block with chunky socks while you hit the books
I make that sacrifice like Jesus preachers on them lames
I'm true with how I feel, no fingers crossed this ain't no game
But you a pimp mayn, I promise you'll that I can change
Like a chameleon the colors on your rings n' thangs

You can have what you want
(You can have what you want)
If you give me what I need
(If you give me what I need)
I know you have a lot of options
(So many other ways)
But baby you belong with me
(Ohh, ohh)

Hey baby girl what's your name who you with?
Do you do wanna get down with this pimpin' lil' trick
Tell me what you like, what you love we can do?
No matter what it is I can make it come true
Never gave da Benz the Ferrari or the Lac
Tell me what you wanna drive and you got it like that?
I'm givin' you the chance this the opportunity
You can have it all but you gotta choose me, choose me
