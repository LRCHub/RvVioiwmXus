I choose you

When love comes along you go with the flow
You should trust your feelings on it
When you get hit by the arrow you'll know
Cupid's aim is always on it

It's half past two now
Your face is lovely
It's only lit by candlelight
Just me and you here
Our room is quiet
Only our sighs and whispers

You don't choose who you fall in love with
You don't mess with the gods of love
You can't choose who you fall in love with
So I choose you

When love comes along you go with the flow
You should trust your feelings on it
When you get hit by the arrow you'll know
Cupid's aim is always on it

You mesmerise me
My head is spinning
This is much more than fantasy
Lost in your kisses
My senses tingle
We lose our inhibitions

You don't choose who you fall in love with
You don't mess with the gods of love
You can't choose who you fall in love with
So I choose you
Ohohohah

I choose
I choose you
I choose
I choose you
I choose
Oh babe I choose you
I choose
I choose you
Whooo

You don't choose who you fall in love with
You don't mess with the gods of love
You can't choose who you fall in love with
So I choose you
Whoo

You don't choose who you fall in love with
You don't mess with the gods of love
You can't choose who you fall in love with
So I choose you
